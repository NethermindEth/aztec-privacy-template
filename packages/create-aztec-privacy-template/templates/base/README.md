# Aztec Privacy Starter (Base Template)

This repository is the protocol-agnostic base scaffold generated by `create-aztec-privacy-template`.

It is intentionally minimal:

1. shared L1 core primitives
2. one neutral generic portal
3. one neutral generic Aztec adapter skeleton
4. minimal tests validating request/finalize + escape behavior

No protocol-specific examples (Aave/Lido/Uniswap) are included in this base. Those are overlay options in later generator phases.

## Architecture

```text
User
  |
  v
Aztec Generic Adapter (private request_*)
  | message_portal(...)
  v
L1 Generic Portal (requestAction)
  | relayer executeAction
  v
Generic Executor hook
  | success => completion message
  | failure => escape registration
  v
Aztec Generic Adapter (private finalize_*)
```

## Quick start

```bash
make install
make check
make test-e2e-fast
```

## Command guide

1. `make build`
Purpose: compile Solidity + Aztec artifacts for the base scaffold.

2. `make test-core`
Purpose: run deterministic unit tests for shared core primitives (`BasePortal`, `EscapeHatch`).

3. `make test-e2e-fast`
Purpose: run minimal generic flow verification for portal request/execute and escape handling.

## Adaptation workflow

1. Start from `packages/protocols/generic/solidity/GenericPortal.sol`.
2. Replace `IGenericActionExecutor` wiring with your protocol integration call(s).
3. Extend `packages/protocols/generic/aztec/src/main.nr` intent fields to match your private flow.
4. Update Generic portal tests first, then add protocol-specific overlays.

## Safety boundaries

This starter is not production-ready as-is. It does not include:

1. relayer service implementation
2. production deployment pipelines
3. frontend application scaffolding
4. production bridge claim operations

Treat this scaffold as a baseline to adapt, document, and harden for your protocol.
